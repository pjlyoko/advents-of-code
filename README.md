Advent of Code 2021 by Pj
=========================

This repository contains my meager tries in solving tasks in Advent of Code 2021. Its existence reason is to:

* keep learning programming in Python 3.9+,
* perceive the progress in programming skills,
* re-learn git,
* learn some new words in English.

**Note.** There's no guarantee that any of the solutions are good. Nor bad. Nor the best. Nor the worst. 😅
