# General notes
During the competition I decided that I'm going to write the code at one or two sittings. I'd like to check how do I write code "at a first glance", "ad hoc".

The notes below are to show my thoughts on the puzzles.


# Day 1: Sonar Sweep
Let's go!


# Day 2: Dive!
Maybe not a note on the puzzle... but I advertised AoC amoung students in school. Two of them joined the leaderboard I created!


# Day 3: Binary diagnostics
On the third day I felt *relief* after completing the second part of the puzzle. This day I also started using **numpy** to sum 1s and 0s (as *True*s and *False*s) by columns of data collected in a 2D matrix.

But, really, if a machine I'd have to work with had given data in the way **this** machine works... I'd probably refuse to do it by conscience clause. üòÅ

As I wrote in a comment in [task03.py](task03.py) file, the code needs refactoring. It's ugly, I think -- two functions could possibly be rewritten as they do almost the same operation.

It was also the day I discovered [/r/adventofcode](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode). I'm glad people share their code -- having some time I'm deffinitely going to check their way of thought and their code.

I really like the visualisations people upload, too!

# Day 4: Giant Squid
"Really, bingo?", thought I when I first read the title. It was a bit simplier task than the previous one, I believe.

I really need to work on reading and interpreting files. I feel that "it's not it".
